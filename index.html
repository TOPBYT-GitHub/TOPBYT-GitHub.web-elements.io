    not all elements like the html and body element are here since every html has them and they are NOT required. (except the DOCTYPE element since it makes browsers open the site!)
    <h1>If you don't know, Web elements (short for website elements) are elements for website that make text bold or make a video player!</h1>
    <h3>To start, we'll start with the easy and obvious ones. (use "View source code" or "Inspect element" to see how to get the elements!)</h3>
    <p><b>Bold Text</b> - makes text bold, useful for inportatnt stuff</p>
    <p><i>Italic Text</i> - if you're on a computer, you have the option to either use the " " (quote) symbol, or use <i>italic text.</i>, useful for some stuff!</p>
    <p>By merging these two together, we get <b><i>Bold-Italic text.</i></b>, which is <b>VERY</b> useful for really important stuff!</p>
    <p><s>Strikethrough/Deleted Text</s> - strikes a line on any string of text, useful for "deleting" text!</p>
    <p>We can merge the Bold and Italic text with the Strikedthrough Text to get, well, <s><b><i>this.</i></b></s>, i- i don't know why would you use this... but okay?</p>
    <h3>Alright, now for the little complicated and a little less obvious ones.</h3>
    <p>Using the letter H and numbers from 1-6 we get a Heading.</p>
    <h1>Heading 1 (h1)</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2 (h2)</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3 (h3)</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4 (h4)</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5 (h5)</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6 (h6)</h6>
    <p>Paragraph - using the P element, we create a</p>
    <p>paragraph!</p>
    <p><i>psst, did you know that you can use the br element to make a new line break without closing the p element? the br tag has NO close tag and the element itself is empty.</i></p>
    <p>Textarea!!!! <textarea></textarea> <br>a text area displays an area that lets you type text... wasn't that obvious?</p>
    <p>The <code>Code();</code> element! (yep i just noticed that) - displays a code srting without actually using it.</p>
    <p><ins>Added text</ins> - underscores text to indicate that a new string of text was added.</p>
    <p>iframe - displays embeds.</p>

    <p><ins style="background-color: #d3fcbc93;
        left: 0.5rem; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">THIS WEBSITE IS UNFINISHED!!</ins></p>
